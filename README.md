## **Abstract (TL;DR)**

This project investigates the impact of socio-economic factors on
employment rates across U.S. states. Utilizing ACS 2021 data, we explore
relationships between employment and variables like education,
citizenship, and housing. Key findings include significant correlations
that inform employment dynamics in the U.S.

## **Motivation**

We aim to analyze various socio-economic factors influencing employment
in the U.S. This study is crucial for understanding how different
aspects like education, age, and housing contribute to employment rates,
thereby aiding policymakers and researchers.

## Summary

We have imported data set from the ACS survey. We have 6 child RMD files
for this project which has the data analysis for the Employment,
Education, Citizenship, Age, Housing, Disabilities Data Set (ACS
2021).  
Further, we started exploring each data set in detail and then we
started combining each data set with the employment to see what results
we can expect. We did find many direct relationships with each data set
on employment data set. We have put our concluding results in the Final
Report to help us stand by with our conclusions.

## Employment

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-27-1.png)<!-- -->

<u>Interpretations:</u>  
High Employment States: The states at the far left, such as Nebraska,
Minnesota, and Iowa, show the highest employment rates, each appearing
to exceed 60%. Low Employment States: On the right side, Puerto Rico,
West Virginia, and Mississippi have the lowest employment rates
depicted, with Puerto Rico showing a rate significantly lower than all
states, possibly below 40%. Variability: The chart shows that there is a
significant variability in employment rates across different states and
territories. This could be due to a variety of factors such as economic
policies, industrial diversity, population demographics, and educational
attainment levels.

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-28-1.png)<!-- -->

The above bar chart shows the number of people who are employed, in
armed forces or unemployed for each state. We can observe that bigger
cities like california, new york, texas etc have the highest number of
people who are employed. We can also notice that unemployment while
compared to employment is less in each city.

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-29-1.png)<!-- -->

The above graph shows the unployment rates across different states. We
can observe that most number of states have an unemployment rate between
1-4.5%

The above chart shows the distribution of employment rates in the form
of a map of the united states for better visualization. We can see that
states like UT,NE,MN have the highest employment rates.

## Education

As a data science student, I’m captivated by how education influences
economic and societal progress. My analysis focuses on how higher
education correlates with improved job prospects and financial
stability. With the wealth of educational data available for
longitudinal study, I’m keen to understand and potentially shape
educational policy. I’m especially interested in how education imparts
essential skills for the modern workforce and promotes adaptability in a
tech-driven world. Ultimately, my work delves into education’s role in
fostering individual growth and its potential to drive societal change.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** based on percentage

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-34-1.png)<!-- --> **Inference
for the above garph**

The bar chart depict the distribution of educational attainment by
state, represented as a percentage of the total population within each
state. From the graph, we can infer that certain states have a higher
percentage of individuals with specific levels of education for instance
the states with larger populations, such as California, Texas, Florida,
and New York, exhibit the highest numbers in educational attainment
across all levels, from below 9th grade to graduate or professional
degrees. This suggests a diverse educational demand and a corresponding
supply of educational institutions and job opportunities that require
various levels of education. California stands out with the highest
numbers in every category, reflecting its vast and diverse educational
landscape. While the prevalence of higher education degrees in states
like Illinois denotes a strong higher education system, the significant
figures for those with less than a high school diploma highlight ongoing
challenges in educational access and retention in these heavily
populated states.

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-37-1.png)<!-- -->

**Inference for above Three Graphs**

The above three bar charts illustrate the distribution of various
education levels across different states. The first chart likely
represents the percentage of the population with a bachelor’s degree,
showing a gradual increase in educational attainment towards District of
columbia states. The second chart appears to show the distribution of
master’s degrees, which, while following a similar pattern, reflects
lower percentages indicative of the reduced number of individuals who
pursue postgraduate education. The third chart, presumably depicting
high school diploma holders, presents a more pronounced variability,
culminating in a steep increase for the last few states. This suggests a
greater disparity in high school graduation rates across states.
Generally, states with higher percentages of bachelor’s and master’s
degree holders also have a high percentage of high school diploma
holders, indicating possible correlations between state education
policies and the value placed on education.

## Citizenship

Citizenship status significantly influences employment prospects, with
non-citizens often facing unique challenges in the job market. Legal
restrictions and specific job requirements tied to citizenship can limit
access to certain professions, hindering career opportunities and
advancement for non-citizens. Employers may encounter administrative
complexities when hiring individuals without citizenship, potentially
impacting their hiring decisions. Discrimination based on immigration
status can further exacerbate challenges for non-citizens in securing
meaningful employment. Balancing national security considerations with
the principles of equal employment opportunities is crucial to fostering
inclusive workplaces that recognize and harness the skills and
contributions of individuals, irrespective of their citizenship status.
Efforts to promote fair employment policies and combat biases contribute
to creating a more equitable job market for all.

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-38-1.png)<!-- -->![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-38-2.png)<!-- -->![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-38-3.png)<!-- -->
The ratio of US Citizens vs Non-US Citizens varies greatly across
various states in the U.S. as you can observe from the graph above.In
general there is a trend observed that , states with lesser US citizens
have a lower employment rate.

## Age

Age is one of the important social factor which affects the job market.
Employers may discriminate against older workers, believing them to be
less productive, adaptable, or tech-savvy. This can lead to age bias in
hiring and promotion practices, affecting older workers’ job
opportunities.Younger workers may be willing to accept lower wages than
older workers, making them more cost-effective for employers.
Contradistinction in some fields older workers often have decades of
experience and accumulated wisdom in their field, making them valuable
assets to any team. They may have a deeper understanding of industry
trends, protocols, and best practices, leading to better problem-solving
and decision-making skills. Due to their experience and expertise, older
workers may require less training than younger colleagues, saving
employers time and resources.

The above plot shows the Percentage of total population in a particular
age group in the state.We can also observe that the proportion of
population in each state in age groups over 64 year and under 18 years
are higher compared to the other age groups.That is expected because the
interval in that category is bigger than the others which are 10 years
interval.

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-41-1.png)<!-- -->

The above plot facets by the proportion of population a particular age
group.Most of the times all the states have almost the same proportion
of people in the different age groups.From this graph we can find if
some state is an outlier for any age group.For example if we look at the
district of Columbia we can see that it has a different trend compared
to the other states of US in almost all the age groups.

### Prime Working Age Group

Workers in their prime years, defined by the government as 25-54
years.This age has started dropping in most parts of the country since
the late 1960s, with steeper declines during recessionary periods.In
1969, the labor force participation rate of men ages 25 to 54 was 96
percent, and in 2015, the rate was under 89 percent according to US
bureau of labor statistics. So, the following graphs are intended to
focus on this prime working age group in states of US in 2021.

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-42-1.png)<!-- -->

The above graph focuses on the proportion of population in the age group
25 to 34 years in the different states of the US. Important inferences
from this graph:

- We see that District of Columbia is a outlier compared to the trend
  from rest of the country.

- It is important that we look at the top five state in this graph
  because we see more or less the same state but in a different order
  when we look at the other categories of prime working ages. The top 5
  states with more population in this age is:

  - Colorado

  - Alaska

  - Washington

  - California

  - Utah

- The 5 state with the lowest proportion of population in this age
  group:

  - West Virginia

  - Vermont

  - Maine

  - Mississippi

  - Wyoming

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-43-1.png)<!-- -->

The above graph focuses on the proportion of population in the age group
35 to 44 years in the different states of the US.This graph shows a
pattern similar to the previous graph. Important inferences from this
graph:

- We see that District of Columbia is a outlier compared to the trend
  from rest of the country in this age group too.

- It is important that we look at the top five state in this graph
  because we see more or less the same state but in a different order
  when we look at the other categories of prime working ages. The top 5
  states with more population in this age is:

  - Colorado

  - Washington

  - Alaska

  - Texas

  - Oregon

  - Utah

- The 5 state with the lowest proportion of population in this age
  group:

  - New Hampshire

The above graph focuses on the proportion of population in the age group
45 to 54 years in the different states of the US.This graph shows a
pattern that is a little different from the previous 2 graphs which
suggest why the declining age of prime working group is a rising issue
in the US. Important inferences from this graph:

- We see that District of Columbia is not a outlier in this age group.

- It is important that we look at the top five state in this graph
  because we see more or less the same state but in a different order
  when we look at the other categories of prime working ages. The top 5
  states with more population in this age is:

  - New Jersey

  - Georgia

  - New Hampshire

  - North Carolina

  - Connecticuit

- The 5 state with the lowest proportion of population in this age
  group:

  - North Dakota

  - South Dakota

  - Utah

  - Montana

  - Nebraska

This graph attempts to look at all the prime working ages at once. We
see overall the top 5 state are:

- Colorado

- Washington

- California

- Nevada

- Texas

## Housing

Housing plays a pivotal role in influencing employment outcomes for
individuals, as the accessibility, affordability, and stability of
housing can significantly impact job opportunities and career
advancement. Housing affordability directly affects an individual’s
financial well-being, and high housing costs relative to income may
force individuals to allocate a substantial portion of their earnings to
housing, leaving less for other essential needs. In some cases,
individuals may face the challenge of commuting long distances due to
housing affordability issues, which can impact their ability to secure
and maintain employment. Moreover, stable and secure housing can
contribute to a positive work environment, enabling individuals to focus
on their careers without the stress and uncertainty associated with
inadequate or unstable housing situations. Policies and initiatives that
address housing affordability, promote stable living conditions, and
encourage equitable urban development can play a crucial role in
supporting individuals in their pursuit of meaningful and sustainable
employment opportunities.

The above two bar charts show’s us the distrubution of precentage of
renter and owner occupied housing by state. We can see that states like
district of columbia, new york, california have the highest number of
people who rent the houses. And, states like west virginia, maine,
michigan have high number of people who own their own property.

## Disabilities

People with disabilities face significant challenges in finding and
maintaining employment. These challenges include lack of accessibility,
workplace accommodations, and negative societal attitudes. They may also
have limited access to suitable job opportunities that cater to their
unique needs, leading to high rates of unemployment or underemployment.
Misconceptions and biases about disabilities can lead to discriminatory
practices, preventing individuals with disabilities from utilizing their
skills and abilities to their full potential in the workforce. To
address these challenges, it is essential to enhance inclusivity, raise
awareness about the capabilities of individuals with disabilities, and
encourage workplace accommodations. By doing so, we can unlock the
potential of a broader talent pool and create workplaces that embrace
diversity, ultimately fostering a more inclusive and supportive
environment for people with disabilities in the workforce.

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-50-1.png)<!-- --> In the bar
chart titled “Disability Rates by State,” I notice a striking range of
disability rates across the U.S. states and territories. Puerto Rico has
the highest rate, over 20%, which is significantly higher than any
state, while states such as West Virginia, Mississippi, and Alabama also
have high rates, each above 15%. In stark contrast, Utah, New Jersey,
California, and the District of Columbia are at the lower end of the
spectrum, with rates around or below 10%. This variation suggests that
factors like healthcare access, occupation-related risks, and
demographic differences could play a role in these rates. From a policy
standpoint, it seems crucial that states with higher disability rates
may need to prioritize services and support systems for disabled
individuals. However, I’m aware that the chart doesn’t break down the
type or severity of disabilities, which would be essential for a more
nuanced understanding and effective policy-making.

The bar chart presents a comparison of different types of disabilities
among residents of Iowa, with ‘Ambulatory difficulty’ being the most
prevalent. This suggests that mobility impairments are a significant
challenge for a large number of Iowans. ‘Independent living difficulty’
also represents a substantial portion, indicating that many individuals
may struggle with daily activities without assistance. Interestingly,
‘Vision difficulty’ is the least common disability, which may reflect
effective preventive care or accessibility to vision correction.
‘Hearing’ and ‘Cognitive’ disabilities fall in the middle range,
signifying that while they are less common than mobility and independent
living issues, they still affect a considerable number of people. This
gives us a indepth analysis for each specific state. Similarly we can
find for other states and dive deeper into the analysis.

## **“Socio-Economic Factors Influencing Employment in the United States: A Comprehensive State-by-State Analysis”**

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png)<!-- -->

    ## $x
    ## [1] "Percentage of Bachelors Degree Holders"
    ## 
    ## $y

    ## 
    ## $title
    ## [1] "Relation between Bachelors Degree Holders and Employment Rate"
    ## 
    ## attr(,"class")
    ## [1] "labels"

The plot suggests a positive correlation where states with a higher
percentage of Bachelor’s degree holders tend to have higher employment
rates, although the relationship does not appear to be very strong. The
spread of the data points is quite broad, especially in the middle range
of the percentage of Bachelor’s degree holders, which implies there are
other factors at play influencing employment rates beyond just higher
education attainment. The confidence interval, shown by the shaded area,
is quite wide, indicating a significant variation in the employment rate
at any given level of Bachelor’s degree holders. This leads me to think
that while education is an important factor in employment, it is
certainly not the only one, and state-specific economic policies,
industries, and other socioeconomic factors might also play crucial
roles.

The above table shows the correlation between all the variables from all
the tables we took for the study. This table is particularly useful to
do the first pick of which variables will be good to compare with each
other. There is one thing we should be careful about when we take
inferences from this table. Some variables are representing almost the
samething so we should not take those variables for drawing conclusions.

The plot shows the number of people in each education level vs the
number of unemployed in that state. The one difference that we can see
is in the slope of the different age groups (the different color
lines).The steepest one being the people with high school level of
eductaion. And the lowest being the number of people with the education
below 9th grade.

From the above graph we can infer that people who are between 18 years
to 34 are the least unemployed amoung various states when compared to
the other ages, with a few outliers. Age 55 to 64 are the most employed
due to them being aged, due to retirement etc.

The above plotly plot shows the percentage of owner-occupied houses vs
unemployment rate for each state.Each point represents and a state and
we can hover over the point to get the corresponding state name and
exact value of unemployment rate and percentage of owner occupied
houses. Although we cannot see any clear pattern we can see that some
points corresponding to Florida Texas and California have higher
percentage of owner occupied housing compared to the otehr states the
other states.

From the above graph, we can infer that, in each state, the number of
people unemployed who are US citizen is more compared to who are not a
US citizen. This could be due to a varity of reasons, few of them are: -
Number of Non-US citizens are less compared to US citizens - Few
companies employ people who have great GPA, academic performance,
extracurrical activities and internation students who come to study in
US tend to do more compared to a resident as they have more
respponsibiltes on their shlolders as shown by a study conducted by Pew
Research. This could also infers that many Non-US citizens in US, who
get a job after studies or who come directly on a work visa tend to get
a job and they stay stable for a period of time.

## Results

1.  Employment vs Education

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png)<!-- -->

The scatter plot labeled “Employment vs Education Levels” shows a
positive correlation between the number of individuals with a Bachelor’s
degree and the number of employed individuals. As I examine the plot, I
notice that as the number of individuals with a Bachelor’s degree
increases, so does the number of employed individuals, suggesting that
higher education levels may be associated with better employment
outcomes. The data points seem to form a rising trend, especially
noticeable in the lower to middle range of the number of individuals
surveyed. However, towards the higher end of the scale, the increase in
employment with respect to the number of Bachelor’s degree holders
becomes less pronounced. This could imply diminishing returns of higher
education on employment at a certain point, or it might reflect a
saturation of highly educated individuals in the job market

2.  Employment Vs Housing

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)<!-- -->

The bar chart titled “Employed Individuals vs States by Housing Type”
displays a comparison of employed individuals in various U.S. states,
differentiated by housing type—owner occupied versus renter occupied.In
most states, the number of employed individuals living in owner-occupied
housing is higher than those in renter-occupied housing. This could
suggest a correlation between home ownership and employment status,
which may be due to a variety of economic and social factors, such as
the stability that home ownership can provide or the possibility that
employed individuals have a higher purchasing power to buy homes.
Notably, in states like California and Texas, the bars representing
owner-occupied housing are significantly taller, which might reflect a
combination of high employment rates and a culture or economy that
favors home ownership. On the other hand, the District of Columbia
stands out with a higher proportion of employed individuals in
renter-occupied housing, which could reflect urban real estate trends
where renting is more common due to high property costs or lifestyle
choices. Overall, the graph suggests a complex relationship between
employment and housing type, influenced by state-specific economic
conditions and housing markets.

3.  Citizenship Vs Employmennt

![](README_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)<!-- -->

The bar chart, titled “Employed Individuals vs States by Citizenship
Status,” shows the number of employed individuals in each state,
categorized by whether they are U.S. citizens or not. Looking at the
chart, I see that U.S. citizens make up the majority of employed
individuals in every state, which is to be expected given the larger
population of citizens versus non-citizens. However, the proportion of
employed non-citizens is noticeable, especially in states like
California and Texas, which may reflect these states’ larger immigrant
populations and their contributions to the workforce. The data also
shows that in states like the District of Columbia, the number of
employed non-citizens is relatively high compared to the total employed
population, indicating diverse labor pools in these areas. This graph
underscores the significant role that non-citizens play in the U.S.
labor market, particularly in states with large urban centers or
industries that attract foreign workers.

## **Conclusions**

This study provides insights into the socio-economic factors affecting
employment in the U.S. Limitations include data scope and potential
biases. Future work could explore more granular data and additional
variables.
